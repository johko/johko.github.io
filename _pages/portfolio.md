Here is some of the work and presentations I have done in the past:

## Community Computer Vision Course
The [Community Computer Vision Course](https://github.com/johko/computer-vision-course) was a project I led and worked on together with over 100 people from the Hugging Face Discord community.

The main idea was to deliver a resource for learning Computer Vision to the collection of great courses found at [hf.co/learn](https://hf.co/learn).

My main role was drafting the initial syllabus, steering the teams and reviewing submissions.

## Conference Talks
Over the past years I have given talks at various conferences, including:

- PyData London 2023 - "Robot Holmes and the Vision-Language Murder Mysteries"
- EuroPython 2024 - "Robot Holmes and the Vision-Language Murder Mysteries"
- Hamburg Python Pizza - "Snow White and the Dwarf Ensemble"
- PyCon Africa 2024 - "How Many Wings Does the Giraffe Have?"
- Swiss Python Summit - "More Than Pixels - Two Vision-Language Adventures"

## Community Talks
Apart from conferences, I also like to give talks in various communities, e.g.

- Computer Vision Africa - "A Short History of Computer Vision"
- Cohere4AI Computer Vision Community - "Deep Learning in Computer Vision"
- Hugging Face Discord Community - Various Computer Vision Study Groups
