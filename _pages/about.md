Hey, I'm Johannes, but mostly you find me as **johko** on all kinds of sites and communities on the internet.

## Work
I'm currently working as a Data Scientist for [celebrate company](https://www.celebrate.company/) and am located in Germany.

## The Cool Stuff Besides Work
Apart from the daily work, I love to engage in the open-source community, especially around topics like Computer Vision and AI ethics. You mostly find me on the [Hugging Face Discord Channel](https://hf.co/join/discord) or on various Python conferences.
